The research consulting performed for [Consorzio per il Trasferimento Tecnologico C2T](https://www.consorzioc2t.it/progetti/) aimed to evaluate the effects and correlations of changes in workplace characteristics on multiple psychophysiological indicators of general and work-related well-being. The research was conducted on a small group of workers who were about to undergo a series of **substantial changes in their workplace spaces**, particularly regarding the lighting system, the aesthetics of the spaces and the office layout.

# Background

The scientific literature in the field of work psychology and occupational health psychology has highlighted a **prominent role of the physical workplace characteristics for employee health and well-being** [[1-2]](#references). For instance, the relevance of the level of lighting for the optimal performance of work activities (e.g. to avoid eye strain and improve concentration) is well known, as well as for [stress levels](/psychophysiology-of-the-stress-response-when-does-stress-cause-ilness/), mood, and particularly for **sleep quality**. On the other hand, office layout is a critical factor for interpersonal exchanges (e.g. presence of meeting rooms) and the perception of **privacy** (e.g. availability of private and/or soundproofed offices), with potential implications for concentration, stress, and perceived comfort (e.g. fewer interruptions). In particular, **functional comfort** concerns the ergonomic support provided by the workplace spaces to individual performance in the work activities [[3]](#references).

# Protocol

Also considering the reduced number of participants, an **Ecological Momentary Assessment** protocol was designed to collect repeated measures of various individual health and well-being indicators. The protocol, lasting **one week**, was repeated identically **before and after the changes** in the workplace spaces.

In both occasions, participants first responded to a short questionnaire about their health, well-being and **perceived comfort**. The protocol then included the use of [experience sampling methods](/experience-sampling-methods-measuring-experiences-in-real-time/) to measure **mood** during work, through the administration of five short questionnaires throughout the workday, via a mobile application. In each of these five assessments, participants also used a second mobile application to measure their **heart rate** via the smartphone camera. Additionally, twice a week, participants also collected salivary samples to measure the **cortisol awakening response** (CAR), a widely used stress biomarker. Finally, throughout the entire week, participants wore an **actigraph**, a wristband that recorded wrist movements, whose data were used to obtain objective indicators of sleep quantity and quality.
