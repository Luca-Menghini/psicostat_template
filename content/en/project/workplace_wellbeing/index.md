The research consultancy conducted for [Consorzio per il Trasferimento Tecnologico C2T](https://www.consorzioc2t.it/progetti/) aimed to evaluate the effects and correlations of changes in workplace characteristics on multiple **psychophysiological indicators of healh and well-being**. The research was conducted with a group of workers who were about to undergo a series of **changes in their workplace spaces**, particularly regarding the lighting system, the aesthetics of the spaces and the office layout.

The scientific literature has highlighted a **prominent role of the physical workplace characteristics for employee health and well-being** [[1-2]](#references). For instance, the lighting levels are notably relevant for the optimal performance of work activities (e.g. to avoid eye strain and improve concentration), as well as for [stress levels](/psychophysiology-of-the-stress-response-when-does-stress-cause-ilness/), mood, and **sleep quality**. Furthermore, office layout is a critical factor for interpersonal exchanges (e.g. presence of meeting rooms) and the perception of **privacy** (e.g. availability of private and/or soundproofed offices), with implications for concentration and [work stress](/workplace-stress-and-the-management-of-psychosocial-hazards-at-work/) (e.g. fewer interruptions), and for **perceived comfort**.

The research consisted of an **Ecological Momentary Assessment** protocol designed to collect repeated measures of multiple individual health and well-being indicators. The protocol, lasting **one week**, was repeated identically **before and after the changes** in the workplace spaces.

In both assessments, participants responded to a short questionnaire about their health, well-being and **perceived comfort**. Then, the protocol included [experience sampling measures](/experience-sampling-methods-measuring-experiences-in-real-time/) to measure **mood** with work with 5 short questionnaires administered throughout the workday, via an open-source mobile application [[3]](#references). In each of these five assessments, participants also used a second mobile app [[4]](#references) to measure their **heart rate variability** via the smartphone camera. Additionally, twice a week, participants also collected salivary samples to measure the **cortisol awakening response** (CAR), a widely used [stress](/psychophysiology-of-the-stress-response-when-does-stress-cause-ilness/) biomarker. Finally, throughout the entire week, participants wore an **actigraph**, a wrist-worn [wearable sensor](/wearable-technology-and-e-health/) that recorded participant movement to get objective indices of sleep quantity and quality.
