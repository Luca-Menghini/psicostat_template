The research consultancy conducted for [Consorzio per il Trasferimento Tecnologico C2T](https://www.consorzioc2t.it/progetti/) aimed to evaluate the effects and correlations of changes in workplace characteristics on multiple **psychophysiological indicators of healh and well-being**. The research was conducted on a small group of workers who were about to undergo a series of substantial **changes in their workplace spaces**, particularly regarding the lighting system, the aesthetics of the spaces and the office layout.

# Background

The scientific literature in work psychology and occupational health psychology has highlighted a **prominent role of the physical workplace characteristics for employee health and well-being** [[1-2]](#references). For instance, the lighting levels are notably relevant for the optimal performance of work activities (e.g. to avoid eye strain and improve concentration), as well as for [stress levels](/psychophysiology-of-the-stress-response-when-does-stress-cause-ilness/), mood, and **sleep quality**. Furthermore, office layout is a critical factor for interpersonal exchanges (e.g. presence of meeting rooms) and the perception of **privacy** (e.g. availability of private and/or soundproofed offices), with potential implications for concentration, stress, and perceived comfort (e.g. fewer interruptions). In particular, **functional comfort** concerns the ergonomic support provided by the workplace spaces to work performance [[3]](#references).

# Protocol

Also considering the reduced number of participants, an **Ecological Momentary Assessment** protocol was designed to collect repeated measures of various individual health and well-being indicators. The protocol, lasting **one week**, was repeated identically **before and after the changes** in the workplace spaces.

In both occasions, participants responded to a short questionnaire about their health, well-being and **perceived comfort**. Then, the protocol included [experience sampling measures](/experience-sampling-methods-measuring-experiences-in-real-time/) to measure **mood** with work with 5 short questionnaires administered throughout the workday, via an open-source mobile application [[4]](#references). In each of these five assessments, participants also used a second mobile app [[5]](#references) to measure their **heart rate variability** via the smartphone camera. Additionally, twice a week, participants also collected salivary samples to measure the **cortisol awakening response** (CAR), a widely used [stress](/psychophysiology-of-the-stress-response-when-does-stress-cause-ilness/) biomarker. Finally, throughout the entire week, participants wore an **actigraph**, a wristband that recorded wrist movements to get objective indicators of sleep quantity and quality.
