I'm a Work and Organizational Psychologist, and a postdoc at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/luca.menghini3/en) of the University of Bologna, mainly working on **Occupational Health Psychology**, and the **Psychophysiology** of  [Stress](/stress-and-workplace-stress/), [Recovery](/recovery-and-recovery-experiences/), and [Sleep](/sleep-sleep-quality-and-stress/).

I'm particularly focused on **innovative research methods** ([Wearable Technology](/wearable-technology-and-e-health/), [Experience Sampling Methods](/experience-sampling-methods/)) to assess the sources of stress (e.g., workload) and the associated psychophysiological responses (e.g., [HRV](/heart-rate-variability-as-an-index-of-stress-and-self-regulation/)) in real time, in participantsâ€™ natural environments such as their workplace. I'm passionate about planning, conducting, and analyzing data ([using R](https://www.r-project.org/)) from field studies.

Here's my [CV](files/cv.pdf).
