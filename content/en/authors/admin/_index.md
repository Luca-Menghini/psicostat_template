I'm a postdoc at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/luca.menghini3/en) of the University of Bologna, working on **Occupational Health Psychology**, and the **Psychophysiology** of  [Stress](/stress-and-workplace-stress/), [Recovery](/recovery-and-recovery-experiences/) and [Sleep](/sleep-sleep-quality-and-stress/).



Over my (still little) experience, I've focused on innovative **research methods** ([Wearable Technology](/wearable-technology-and-e-health/), [Experience Sampling Methods](/experience-sampling-methods/)) to assess the sources of stress (e.g., workload) and the associated psychophysiological responses in real time, in participantsâ€™ natural environments. By means of [Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)](/ecological-momentary-assessment/), I've collected self-report (psychological testing), physiological ([Heart Rate Variability](/heart-rate-variability-as-an-index-of-stress-and-self-regulation/)), and behavioral measures (cognitive testing) to **analyse the stressor-strain relationship** with a [Multilevel Approach](/multilevel-modeling/).

I'm passionate about planning (using my brain + the existing literature), conducting (using [EMA protocols](#projects)), and analyzing data ([using R](https://www.r-project.org/)) from field studies. I also love **playing bass**! ðŸŽ¸
