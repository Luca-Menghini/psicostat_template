  Experience sampling methods are increasingly used in workplace stress assessment, 
  yet rarely developed and   validated following the available best practices. Here, 
  we developed and evaluated parsimonious measures of momentary   stressors (Task Demand 
  and Task Control) and the Italian adaptation of the Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire 
  as an   indicator of momentary strain (Negative Valence, Tense Arousal, and Fatigue). 
  Data from 139 full-time office workers   that received seven experience sampling 
  questionnaires per day over 3 workdays suggested satisfactory validity (including 
  weak invariance cross-level isomorphism), level-specific reliability, and sensitivity 
  to change. The scales also showed   substantial correlations with retrospective measures 
  of the corresponding or similar constructs and a degree of sensitivity to work sampling 
  categories (type and mean of job task, people involved). Opportunities and recommendations 
  for the investigation and the routine assessment of workplace stress are discussed.
