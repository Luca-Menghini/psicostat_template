abstract: 'KEY POINTS: (1) Consumer sleep technologies (CSTs) are largely unregulated.
  Understanding the rationale behind the technology, the challenges, and the limitations
  of CSTs is critical for an informed and proper adoption of these technologies in
  research and clinical applications. (2) CSTs have a growing number of sensor capabilities,
  with multisensory devices having the potential of advancing the accuracy in sleep
  tracking and also enabling assessment of the functioning of other body systems,
  such as autonomic functioning. (3) CSTs have the potential to advance understanding
  of sleep and its importance in health, disease, safety, and human performance.'
