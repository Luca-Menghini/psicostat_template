## Edit your post metadata

The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata ([front matter](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/)).

In Jupter, choose _Markdown_ as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter: 

```
---
title: My post's title
date: 2019-09-01

# Put any other Academic metadata here...
---
```

Edit the metadata of your post, using the [documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content) as a guide to the available options.

To set a [featured image](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#featured-image), place an image named `featured` into your post's folder.
