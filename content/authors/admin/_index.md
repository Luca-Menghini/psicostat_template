I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/luca.menghini3/en) of the University of Bologna. I'm working within the research areas of **Occupational Health Psychology**, and the **Psychophysiology** of  [Stress](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/stress-and-workplace-stress/), [Recovery](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/recovery-and-recovery-experiences/) & [Sleep](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/sleep-sleep-quality-and-stress/). 

Over my (still little) research experience, I've focused on innovative research methods (**Wearable Technology**, **Experience Sampling Methods**) to assess the sources of stress (e.g., workload), and the associated psychophysiological responses in real time, in participantsâ€™ natural environment. By means of **Ecological Momentary Assessment** protocols, I've conducted **Intensive Longitudinal Studies** collecting self-report (psychological testing), physiological (heart rate variability), and behavioral measures (cognitive testing), and analyzing the stressor-strain relationship with a **multilevel approach**.

What I am most passionate about is planning (using my brain + the existing literature), conducting (using EMA protocols), and analyzing data (**using R**) from field studies. 

I also love **playing bass**!
