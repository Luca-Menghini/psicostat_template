I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/luca.menghini3/en) of the University of Bologna - Alma Mater Studiorum. I've a background in **I/O Psychology** and **Applied Psychophysiology**, and especially on the assessment and management of **workplace stress**.

I'm working within the research areas of **Occupational Health Psychology**, and the Psychophysiology of Stress, Recovery & Sleep quality. 

Over my (still little) research experience, I've mainly focused on innovative research methods methods (**wearable technology, experience sampling methods**) to assess sources of (e.g., workload) and the psychophysiological responses to stress (e.g., mood, heart rate variability) in real time, in participantsâ€™ natural environment. 

By means of **Ecological Momentary Assessment** protocols, I conducted several multi-day studies collecting self-report (questionnaires, experience sampling), physiological (heart rate variability, skin conductance), and behavioral measures (actigraphy, cognitive testing), and analyzing the stressor-strain relationship with a **multilevel approach**.

What I am most passionate about is planning (using my brain plus the existing literature), conducting (using EMA protocols), and analyzing data (**using R**) from field studies.
