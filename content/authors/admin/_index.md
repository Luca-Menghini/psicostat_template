I'm a postdoc at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/luca.menghini3/en) of the University of Bologna, working on **Occupational Health Psychology**, and the **Psychophysiology** of  [Stress](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/stress-and-workplace-stress/), [Recovery](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/recovery-and-recovery-experiences/) and [Sleep](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/sleep-sleep-quality-and-stress/).

Over my (still little) research experience, I've focused on innovative **research methods** ([Wearable Technlology](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/wearable-technology/), [Experience Sampling Methods](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/experience-sampling-methods/)) to assess the sources of stress (e.g., workload) and the associated psychophysiological responses in real time, in participantsâ€™ natural environments. By means of [Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/ecological-momentary-assessment/), I've collected self-report (psychological testing), physiological (heart rate variability), and behavioral measures (cognitive testing) to **analyse the stressor-strain relationship** with a [Multilevel Approach](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/multilevel-approach/).

I'm passionate about planning (using my brain + the existing literature), conducting (using [EMA protocols](/projects)), and analyzing data ([using R](https://www.r-project.org/)) from field studies. I also love **playing bass**! ðŸŽ¸
