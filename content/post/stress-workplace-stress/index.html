<p>Workplace stress is a highly prevalent phenomenon associated with substantial individual, organizational, and societal costs. Over the last decades, robust theoretical frameworks have been provided to characterize the stress response both physiologically and psychologically. These resulted in consolidated models of job stress, as well as in normative frameworks aiding organizations to identify, assess, and manage the psychosocial hazards in the work force.</p>

<h1>Psychophysiology of the stress response</h1>
<p>Stress is a complex and <strong>multifaceted phenomenon</strong>, involving multiple dimensions placed on <strong>different epistemological levels</strong>, and investigated by different disciplines (e.g., physics, biology, medicine, psychology). In turn, stress is influenced by several factors of various nature (e.g., biochemical, genetic, psychosocial) with a <strong>transitory</strong> (e.g., exam), <strong>chronic</strong> (e.g., war), and even <strong>dispositional</strong> time course (e.g., anxiety disorder), and it is associated with individual <strong>health &amp; well-being</strong>.</p>

<h2>Historical origins of stress research</h2>
<p>The term “stress” comes from the Latin “<em>strictus</em>” (narrow), initially used to describe an elastic body’s response (pressure changes called “<em>strain</em>”, i.e., tension) to an external force. Then, the French physiologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bernard">Claude Bernard (1813-1878)</a> started using the term “<em>estresse</em>” to characterize the body’s defence reactions to strong external stimulations. Following Berdard’s work, the North American physiologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bradford_Cannon">Walter Cannon (1871-1045)</a> identified a global response through which the <strong>Autonomic Nervous System</strong> (ANS) reacts to threatening stimuli in order to maintain <strong>homeostasis</strong> (the normal physiological balance of the body): the <strong>alarm reaction</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Autonomic Nervous System (ASN)</strong> is a component of the peripheral nervous system that is traditionally thought to be <strong>involuntarily controlled</strong> (as opposed to the somatic nervous system, although recent evidence highlighted the possibility to voluntarily control some of its components, e.g., using biofeedback). The ANS is composed by two branches, both innervating most of our organs, muscles, and other cardiovascular systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the  <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong> , being overall characterized by an activating function (e.g., phasic heart rate increase, increased muscle oxygenation) to prepare the body to action. This is the system involved in the <strong>alarm reaction</strong> identified by Cannon, often referred as the “<strong><em>fight-or-flight</em></strong>” response.</p></li>
<li><p>the  <strong>parasymphatetic nervous system</strong> , being overall characterized by an inhibiting function (e.g., tonic heart rate decrease, increased oxygenation of internal organs to promote digestive functions). As typically opposed to the symphatetic system, the parasymphatetic branch is often referred as the “<strong><em>rest-and-digest</em></strong>” system.</p></li>
