***Experience Sampling Methods (ESM)*** *include a set of tools for the repeated and systematic sampling of psychological states, experiences, and activities in real time, during daily life*.

As described by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi), one of the main ESM pioneers and developers, the objective of ESM is "*to obtain self-report for a representative sample of moments in people's life*", in order to study the **frequency, intensity and patterning** of self-reported experiences (thoughts, psychological states etc.), and daily activities (social interactions, changes in locations etc.) over time [[1]](#references).

To keep it simpler, Experience Sampling means asking individuals to provide systematic self-reports by administering short (e.g., max 10-20 items) and consistent measures (always the same questions) multiple times per day, over multiple days.

ESM are increasingly used in several fields of psychological research (e.g., see examples in [I/O](https://wikipedia.com), [clinical psy](https://wikipedia.com), and [social psychology](https://wikipedia.com), due to their recognized **advantages over retrospective self-reports**.

## ESM vs. retrospective reports

**Retrospective self-reports** can be considered as the gold standard for measuring subjective ratings of psychological constructs. They usually consist in asking individuals to rate a number of items **referred to the past** (e.g., over the last six months, over the last year). Ratings are often given on a Likert scale, with response labels being expressed in terms of agreement or frequency.

Here's a retrospective item often used in [workplace stress](/stress-and-workplace-stress/) research:

### Recall biases and other confounders

Now imagine rating the first item in the afternoon, just after an **infrequent and intense fight with your boss** you had in the morning. You're probably going to overestimate the frequency of work-related interpersonal conflicts due to the **salience** (infrequent event) and **recency** (happened this morning) of this conflictual episode.

Salience and recency effects, as well as further **recall biases** such as the [availability heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), are **mental shortcut** potentially involved each time we retrieve some information from our memory. Whether these shortcut are necessary to provide us with an adequate **cognitive efficiency**, they are likely to produce **systematic distortions** in retrospective reports.

Further widely investigated **response biases** influencing self-reported ratings include [social desideraiblity](https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/n537.xml) (the tendency to answer in a way perceived by respondents as more socially acceptable than would be their "true" answer), the [halo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) (the tendency to generalize positive/negative rating of specific area of a rated object to other areas of the same object). These biases can be grouped into the **response-style biases** category, including a range of measurement and individual characteristics leading to nonrandom deviations of the rating from its true value [[2]](#references).

Among the most critical individual characteristics, **negative affectivity**

Let's see another example from [workplace stress](/stress-and-workplace-stress/):
