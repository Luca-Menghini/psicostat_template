***Experience Sampling Methods (ESM)*** *are defined as a set of tools for the repeated and systematic sampling of psychological states, experiences, and activities in real time, during daily life*. 

As described by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi), one of the main ESM pioneers and developers, the objective of ESM is "to obtain self-report for a representative sample of moments in people's life", in order to study the **frequency, intensity and patterning** of self-reported experiences (thoughts, psychological states etc.), and daily activities (social interactions, changes in locations etc.) [1].

To keep it simpler, Experience Sampling means asking individuals to provide systematic self-reports by administering short (e.g., max 10-20 items) and consistent measures (always the same questions) multiple times per day, over multiple days.

## Advantages over retrospective reports

ESM are increasingly used in several fields of psychological research (e.g., see examples in [I/O psy](https://wikipedia.com), [OH psy](https://wikipedia.com), [clinical psy](https://wikipedia.com), and [social psy](https://wikipedia.com), due to their recognized advantages over retrospective self-reports. 

**Retrospective self-reports** can be considered as the gold standard for measuring subjective ratings of psychological constructs. They usually consist in asking individuals to rate a number of items **referred to the past** (e.g., over the last six months, over the last year). Ratings are often given on a Likert scale, with response labels being expressed in terms of agreement or frequency.

Here's an example of retrospective measures often used in [workplace stress](https://lucamenghini.netlify.app/2019/07/12/stress-and-workplace-stress/) research:
