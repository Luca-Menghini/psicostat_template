title: Sleep, sleep quality and stress
---

Sleep is a fondamental process in our daily life, accounting for the _x_% of our life time. While sleep quality is a core aspect of our general health and wellbeing, it is deeply affected by the stressful events and the associated cognitions and emotions, possibly leading to vicious circles where more and more distress is perceived, and poorer and poorer sleep is experienced. Specifically, several empirical studies provided evidence of negative reciprocal associations between [workplace stress](...) and sleep quality.

# Psychophysiology of sleep

Sleep is a central part of our life, approximately accounting for about **the _x_% of the time**. This means that a person living for 85 years will spend approximately _x_ years sleeping. Impressive, isn'it? Such a long time characterized by **inactivity and unconsciousness** has been interpreted as a proof that sleep implies fundamental processes that are functional to our survival. One of these processes is, of course, [recovery](...) that is the replenishment of the physiological and psychological resources spend during the day. Further fundamental functions attributed to sleep include ..... Memory ...

Whatever its functions are, sleep is characterized by several marked changes in the psychophysiological status of the individual, which have been well characterized by decades of scientific research. Psychological changes include the switch from consciousness to **unconsciousness**, with a decreasing alertness becoming .....sensorial blindness....., ...., and inactive behaviour.

Physiological changes involves the brain and the whole body. The most informative physiological signal related to sleep is probably **the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal**, consisting of the electical activity recorded on the scalp, representing .... the sum of the electrical activity of all the underlying structures ..... Specific changes in the EEG signals have been shown to clearly distinguish wake from weak activity, as well as qualitatively different partitions of sleep, called **sleep stages**.

The main distinction is between **rapid-eye-movement (REM)** and non-REM (NREM) sleep. While the latter is more in line with the common idea of sleep, showing an overall pattern of inactivated brain activity, REM sleep is physiologically much closer to wake, with ..., in addition (of course!) to rapid eye movements. NREM sleep is in turn composed by three stages: N1, when we're getting asleep but we're still quite sensitive to sensorial stimulations, N2, characterized by a lower sensorial sensitivity, and ..., and N3, also called **slow-wave sleep (or 'deep' sleep)**, with the minimum sensitivity to external stimulation, and ...

Sleep stages continuously alternate over the night, moving from wake to N1, N2, then slow-wave, then REM, and again N1 and so on. Each **sleep cycle** lasts about 90 minutes, with more and more REM sleep and less and less deep sleep as we approach the morning. This is also why we often wake up remembering a dream, since dreams are more likely to be experienced during REM sleep, which is more frequent in the last part of the night. The visual representations of sleep cycles is called **hypnogram** (I love this term!), and it looks like this:

But sleep stages are not only characterized by different patterns of EEG activity. A central role in the physiological processes characterizing sleep is also played by the two branches of the **autonomic nervous system**.

Based on this, you might predict that sleep physiology is **mainly parasymphatetically-driven**, and you're right! However, the ANS activity is not constant over the whole sleep period. Indeed, it is possible to discriminate sleep stages also based on the pattern of ANS-mediated processes. For instance, heart rate and blood pressure ...

## Distruped sleep, insomnia and other sleep disorders

As good sleep is a core aspect of our health and wellbeing, **poor sleep** is a symptom that characterizes many somatic and mental disorders. Focusing on the latter, **depression** is ...

In turn, **distruped sleep** is associated with a number of dysfunctions ranging from diurnal sleepiness, fatigue, and decreased alertness (negatively impacting our performance and safety) to increased cardiovascular risk, ... **Insomnia** is probably the most known and severe sleep disorder, characterized by ...

# How to measure sleep?

The gold standard method for measuring sleep is **polysomnography (PSG)**, involving a number of ... By inspecting all these biosignals, trained sleep scientists review the whole PSG recording to classify each 30-second epoch as wake, N1, N2, N3, or REM sleep, a procedure called **sleep scoring**. Of course this procedure is very time-consuming, and sleep researchers are increasingly attempting to make it automatic by developing **machine learning algorithms** to identify the main PSG features that discriminate sleep stages as close as possible to manual rating.

Psg picture

The accepted alternative to PSG is **actigraphy**, consisting of an accelerometric sensor, usually placed on the wrist, that detects movements over one (usually Y) or more axes (X, Y, and Z). Actigraphy is based on the definition of **sleep as the absence of movement**, with actigraphic algorithms classifying each epoch as sleep or wake based on the movement in that and in the previous and following epochs. Wheres actigraphy is ideal for conducting **intensive longitudinal studies** (in which participants wear acrigraphs typically for 7-to-14 days, which would be impossible with PSG), the assumption that we don't move while sleeping implies the disadvantage of **missclassifying motionless wake as sleep**. Indeed, while actigraphy is often characterized by a **high sensitivity** (the ability to correctly classify sleep epochs), it usually show a **low specificity** (the ability to correctly classify wake epochs).

More recently, the advancements in [wearable technology](wearable-post) have allowed to integrate actigraphy with further sensors accounting for some of the ASN changes described above. **Heart rate** and [heart rate variability](hrv-post) are probably the most commonly measured biosignals, but the range of indices potentially measurable by these devices is much wider, as we reviewed in [this article](/publication/2020_dezambotti_conumer_sleep_trackers_review/).

In particular, several consumer-oriented companies are increasingly developing devices (mainly wristbands and rings) and algorithms integrating multi-sensor information to discriminate sleep and wake, with some of them also providing **sleep stages**. Of course, commercial trackers imply a number of limitations, such as the use of **proprietary algorithms** (which are mostly undisclosed by wearable companies), and tha lack of evidence on their accuracy. But as sleep scientists and clinicians are increasingly aknowledging the opportunities implies by these devices, more and more studies (such as [our research on adolescents with and without insomnia](link to article)) are **testing their performance against PSG**. For instance, we recently proposed an [analytical standardized framework](
